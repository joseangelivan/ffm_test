// This file is used to declare modules for packages that don't have types
// or to extend existing types.
// It is recommended to create a separate file for each module declaration.

// For example, if you were using a library that didn't have types, you could
// declare the module here.
// declare module 'some-library'

// If you need to extend a type from a library, you can do so here.
// For example, to add a property to the Request object in Express, you could
// do the following:
// declare namespace Express {
//   export interface Request {
//     myProperty: string;
//   }
// }
declare module 'bcrypt';
